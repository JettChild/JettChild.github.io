    <h1>Fly Fishing</h1>
    <p>
      Fly fishing is one of my favorite outdoor activities. I grew up being raised by my parents in the
  Uinta Mountains, where I first learned how to fish using a traditional spinning rod.
  On my 10th birthday, my grandpa gave me my first fly rod and reel, and that summer he taught me
  the fundamentals of fly fishing. He would lay out a hula hoop and have me practice casting my fly
  into the target from different distances to develop accuracy and control.
  Over the years, I’ve continued to build on those skills and have been fortunate enough to fish
  some of the most challenging waters in America, including salmon fishing in Alaska.
